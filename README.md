![](a1.png)

Greetings! We'll use common health signs to forecast illnesses in this project. Our goal is to develop a model that can precisely detect diseases based on fundamental symptoms and health indicators using the Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile Dataset.

This project will provide us a thorough overview of how to forecast illnesses based on fundamental medical data and also we will see how the fundamental diseases are correlated.
